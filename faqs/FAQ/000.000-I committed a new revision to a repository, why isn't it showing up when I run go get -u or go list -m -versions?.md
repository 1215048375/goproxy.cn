If you're using the [goproxy.cn](https://goproxy.cn) as your Go module proxy.
Then you need to know in order to improve caching and serving latencies, new
revisions may not show up right away. If you want new revision to be immediately
available in the [goproxy.cn](https://goproxy.cn), then first make sure there is
a semantically versioned tag for this revision in the source repository. Then
explicitly request that tagged version via `go get module@version`. After couple
of minutes for caches to expire, the `go` command will see that tagged version.
