# Goproxy China

A trusted Go module proxy located in China.

This project has fully implemented the Go's
[module proxy protocol](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_proxy_protocol).
And it's a non-profit project that will (when it is fully tested) run on China's
well-trusted cloud service provider [Qiniu Cloud](https://www.qiniu.com). The
goal of this project is to provide a free, trusted, always on, and CDNed Go
module proxy for Gophers in China and around the world.

Happy coding, Gophers! ;-)

## FAQ

**Q: Why create this project?**

A: Due to the Chinese government's network supervision system, there are lot of
modules in the Go ecosystem that Chinese Gophers cannot `go get`, such as the
most famous `golang.org/x/...`. And the speed of getting modules from GitHub in
the mainland of China is a bit slow. So I created this project to make Gophers
in China better use Go modules. In fact, since the `goproxy.cn` has beend CDNed,
Gophers in other countries can also use it.

**Q: Is this project legal in China?**

A: The `goproxy.cn` will be a business-supported project rather than a personal
project. This means that the `goproxy.cn` will be **fully legal** in China and
we will try our best to spread it.

**Q: Why not use the `proxy.golang.org`?**

A: The `proxy.golang.org` has been blocked in the mainland of China. So, no.
