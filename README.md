# Goproxy China

A trusted Go module proxy located in China.

This project has fully implemented the Go's
[module proxy protocol](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_proxy_protocol).
And it's a non-profit project that will (when it is fully tested) run on China's
well-trusted cloud service provider [Qiniu Cloud](https://www.qiniu.com). The
goal of this project is to provide a free, trusted, always on, and CDNed Go
module proxy for Gophers in China and around the world.

Happy coding, Gophers! ;-)
