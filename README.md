# Goproxy China

The most trusted Go module proxy in China.

Goproxy China has fully implemented the Go's
[module proxy protocol](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Module_proxy_protocol).
And it's a non-profit project that will (when it is fully tested) run on China's
well-trusted cloud service provider [Qiniu Cloud](https://www.qiniu.com). Our
goal is to provide a free, trusted, always on, and CDNed Go module proxy for
Gophers in China and the rest of the world.

Happy coding, Gophers! ;-)

## FAQ

**Q: Why create Goproxy China?**

A: Due to the Chinese government's network supervision system, there are lot of
modules in the Go ecosystem that Chinese Gophers cannot `go get`, such as the
most famous `golang.org/x/...`. And the speed of getting modules from GitHub in
the mainland of China is a bit slow. So we created Goproxy China to make Gophers
in China better use Go modules. In fact, since the
[goproxy.cn](https://goproxy.cn) will be CDNed, Gophers in other countries can
also use it.

**Q: Is Goproxy China legal in China?**

A: The Goproxy China will be a business-supported project rather than a personal
project. This means that it will be **fully legal** in China.

**Q: Why not use the [proxy.golang.org](https://proxy.golang.org)?**

A: The [proxy.golang.org](https://proxy.golang.org) has been blocked in the
mainland of China. So, no.
